        <p>
          As of today, with a wallet containing {{initialTitanoCapital}} Titano, if you want to
          withdraw {{desiredPeriodicWithdraw}}‚Ç¨/{{monthlyWithdraw ? "Month" : "Week"}} <b>after slippage & taxes</b>,
          meaning {{periodicTitanoWithdrawal() | numberFormat}} Titano/{{monthlyWithdraw ? "Month" : "Week"}} gross, you will need to wait
          until <b>{{startDate() | date: dateFormat}}</b>, that is, <b>{{daysNeeded()}} days from today </b>.
        </p>
      </mat-expansion-panel>

        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          From {{startDate() | date: dateFormat}}, you'll be able to withdraw {{desiredPeriodicWithdraw}}‚Ç¨/{{monthlyWithdraw ? "Month" : "Week"}}
          and
          still be able to increase your Titano holdings!
        </p>
        <p>
          To be precise, on that day your wallet will contain {{totalTitanoBalance(daysNeeded()) | numberFormat}} Titano
          but, since you'd need to withdraw only {{periodicTitanoWithdrawal() | numberFormat}} of them, your wallet will
          still increase by {{totalTitanoBalance(daysNeeded()) - periodicTitanoWithdrawal() | numberFormat}} Titano üéâ
