    <div>Every month, I would like to take profit for <input [(ngModel)]="desiredMonthlyWithdraw"/> Euro.</div>
    <div>
      My wallet contains <input [(ngModel)]="initialTitanoCapital"/> Titano, with current price of <input
      [(ngModel)]="titanoPrice"/> Euro/Titano.
    </div>
    <div>
      I assume slippage fees of <input [(ngModel)]="feesPercentage"/> % and taxes around <input
      [(ngModel)]="taxesPercentage"/> %.
    </div>

    <div>
      With a wallet containing, as of today, {{initialTitanoCapital}} Titano, if you want to
      withdraw {{desiredMonthlyWithdraw}}â‚¬/Month <b>after slippage & taxes</b>,
      meaning {{monthlyTitanoWithdrawal() | numberFormat}} Titano/Month gross, you will need to wait
      until {{startDate() | date: dateFormat}} , that is, <b>{{daysNeeded()}} days from today </b>.
    </div>
    <div>
      From {{startDate() | date: dateFormat}}, you'll be able to withdraw {{desiredMonthlyWithdraw}}â‚¬ every month and
      still be able to increase your Titano holdings!
    </div>
    <div>
      To be precise, your Titano holdings on {{startDate() | date: dateFormat}} will
      be {{totalTitanoBalance(daysNeeded()) | numberFormat}} Titano but, since you'd need to withdraw
      only {{monthlyTitanoWithdrawal() | numberFormat}} of them, your wallet will still increase
      by {{totalTitanoBalance(daysNeeded()) - monthlyTitanoWithdrawal() | numberFormat}} Titano ðŸŽ‰
    </div>
