    By enabling this feature, you take full responsibility of using the correct tax %, according to your Country's
    taxation laws.

  <p>
    The calculator will therefore assume that the amount you want to withdraw is <b>after taxes</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example: if you want to withdraw 700{{data.symbol}}/{{data.monthlyWithdrawal ? 'Month' : 'Week'}}, and your
    Country's taxes amount to 30%, then the calculator will internally ensure your gross income will be,
    every {{data.monthlyWithdrawal ? 'month' : 'week'}}, about 1000{{data.symbol}}.
